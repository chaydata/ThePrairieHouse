# The Prairie House
Text adventure game script written in Adventuron, for Spring Thing 2022 and Slow Jam Winnipeg 2022 Game Jams (Mar 2022).
"A student finishes their prairie field work but has to spend the night alone at an old house." 

## GitHub code and License info
I decided to post the source code in case others making games in Adventuron want to add a similar feature in their game, make a similar kind of game, or just want to see how it works.
Please feel free to use the code for your own games (no credit needed). Just don't take the whole thing or very large chunks without changing it much or at all - that's no fun! Note that this was written for the Adventuron betabeta version, which is slightly different from the current standard classroom.
